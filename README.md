Smartthings Edge Drivers etc.

Standalone Edge drivers for Secure Thermostats: SRT323 and SRT321.
These Edge drivers are both based on the Smartthings Community Z-Wave Thermostat.
Ideally they would be sub-drivers of the Community Z-Wave Thermostat but I needed to get them working before 
Smartthings Groovy stopped working and the weather got cold. I have since received am email saying Groovy might live till December.
Please advise me if I am not crediting the right people or am using the wrong license.
